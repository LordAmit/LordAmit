### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Computer Science Department, William & Mary, Co-advised by Dr. Adwait Nadkarni and Dr. Denys Poshyvanyk. I am currently researching Computer Security and Software Engineering as part of the SPL and SEMERU research groups.

Using software engineering techniques, I research to create systematic frameworks that can help fix/find security related issues in existing software or approaches.

I also work on open source projects at my free time (and make my research related source codes open as soon as possible!), which is why I am here. To learn more about me, you are welcome to browse the repos I have as well as the following links!
